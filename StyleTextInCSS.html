            Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing
            a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming
            involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource
            consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly
            referred to as coding)
        </p>

        <p>
            The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers,
            rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of
            programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be
            as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming
            thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application
            domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
